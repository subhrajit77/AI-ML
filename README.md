# 🤖 AI/ML Projects Repository

Welcome to my AI/ML projects repository! This is a collection of personal projects where I will be exploring, implementing, and experimenting with various artificial intelligence and machine learning techniques. 

## 📚 Overview

This repository serves as a portfolio of my journey in AI/ML, featuring:

- **📊 Machine Learning Algorithms**: Implementations of popular algorithms such as linear regression, decision trees, random forests, support vector machines, and more.
- **🧠 Deep Learning Models**: Projects using neural networks, including convolutional neural networks (CNNs) for image processing and recurrent neural networks (RNNs) for sequence modeling.
- **📝 Natural Language Processing (NLP)**: Experiments in text classification, sentiment analysis, language modeling, and more.
- **🖼️ Computer Vision**: Image classification, object detection, and other visual recognition tasks.
- **🔬 Data Science**: End-to-end projects involving data cleaning, exploration, feature engineering, model training, and evaluation.
- **🚀 Research and Development**: Exploratory projects inspired by recent advancements in AI/ML, including custom models and innovative approaches to problem-solving.

## 🚀Getting Started
